# Share Log Monitor for CGMiner

This is a cgminer compatible sharelog monitor written in Node.js. It's mission is to submit share details to some website (e.g. a mining dashboard) as they are found by cgminer.  It was originally developed to be used along with [Bitcoin Command Center](https://github.com/ervwalter/bitcoin-command).
